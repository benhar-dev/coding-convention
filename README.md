# Coding Convention

> Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designerâ€™s intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control. - Grady Booch author of Object Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications

## Opening Statement

This coding convention has been created to help keep our code base clean and tidy. It will act as a guide for those of you who have not settled on a standard, and will impose rules on those of you who wish to contribute.
